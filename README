the ratio of released drug mass is printed as newline-separated values to the specified file path.

the model's state is printed in a multi-column format. rows are separated by newlines, columns by tabs. layout is as follows:

first column : cell state as follows:
      	       	    0 = drug,
		    1 = excipient, 
		    2 = drug dissolving,
		    3 = excipient dissolving
		    4 = fully wetted
		    5 = polymer
		    6 = void
		    7 = boundary (zero concentration)

second column : drug concentration

third column : excipient concentration

example: 64 steps on a side, 1000 iterations, output state every 100 iterations:
./celldiff -n64 -c1000 -t100

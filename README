celldiff arguments

-n, --cubelength        : (32) n  umber of cells on each side of cube
-c, --maxiterations     : (100)  maximum iterations to perform before stopping
-p, --polymer           : (0.3)  polymer concentration in [0, 1]
-g, --drug              : (0.1)  drug concentration in [0, 1]
-h, --cylinderheight    : (0.23) height of cylinder as a ratio of cube length
-r, --releasedfile      : filname for exporting release curve. defaults to a timestamped name
-s, --statefile         : filename for exporting full state data. defaults to a timestamped name
-t, --stateperiod       : (0)    how often to export full state data; 0 == never 
-d, --nochangecount     : (100)  how many consecutive unchanging iterations before halting
-e, --seed              : (47)   random number seed (unsigned integer)
-a, --asciiperiod       : (1)    set the frame period in iterations for drawing ascii animation
-o, --dissdenom         : (1.0)  set the dissolution probability scale, e.g. the probability of dissolving is multiplied by o
-i, --disspolyscale     : (0.0) set the scaling of polymer percent / dissolution probability denominator
-w, --polyshellwidth    : (1) set the width of the polymer shell (calculated in 8-cell, 2x2x2 blocks)
-b, --polyshellbalance  : (1.0)  set the distribution of polymer in the shell, as an "imbalance factor"
-f, --boundarydiffusion : (0.9) set an exponential decay factor for concentrations in boundary cells

the ratio of released drug mass is printed as newline-separated values to the specified file path.

the model's state is printed in a multi-column format. rows are separated by newlines, columns by tabs. layout is as follows:

first column : cell state as follows:
      	       	    0 = drug,
		    1 = excipient, 
		    2 = drug dissolving,
		    3 = excipient dissolving
		    4 = fully wetted
		    5 = polymer
		    6 = void
		    7 = boundary (zero concentration)

second column : drug concentration

third column : excipient concentration

example: 64 steps on a side, 1000 iterations, output state every 100 iterations:
./celldiff -n64 -c1000 -t100
